## Key concepts

A **project** (dashboard) is the most important feature of PROJECT_NAME. Projects
combine different elements (Reference datasets, indicators, and context layers)
and enable data visualization/analysis for all end users.

**Context layers** are geospatial layers used to contextualise the information
presented in a project.

**Indicators layers** derive from spreadsheets or other intelligence assets
harvested by the platform.

**Widgets** are visual components such as charts generated by performing data
analysis on country/regional levels and the indicator data.
